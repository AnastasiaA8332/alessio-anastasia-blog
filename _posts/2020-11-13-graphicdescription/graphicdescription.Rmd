```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```

```{r}
SciViews::R
data <- read("urchin_bio", package = "data.io")
```

We analyse in this database, datas are about urchins in the marin environment and urchin in a farm.

```{r}
chart(urchin_bio, ~ weight %fill=% origin) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 30, na.rm = TRUE)
```
The weight of urchins "farm" is more bigger than urchins "fishery". Urchins "farm" are farm for the commercialisation ; it's why they are bigger.
